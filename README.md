### TuraApp
Just want to say I ported the [Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut) from The Cherno to DirectX 11 since I wanted it in DirectX 11 instead.
So all credits goes to him. 
This port works as the Walnut that The Cherno Made.

Reasons is I am more used to DirectX 11 and don't know much about vulkan.
Therefore I ported it to DirectX 11.

Reason is I wanted to multi thread the loading of images and that why since I don't know vulkan.
So in this port you can load all images on another thread while still running the app to have no downtime.
Will be coming out with a example app in the future :D

### Features
- [x] Multithreaded image loading

Thats about it for now.
